# Markowitz_investment_model
using US stock data to implement Markowitz_investment_model 
2. DJIA DATA containing the monthly percent price change of the 30 components
of the DJIA from January 2012 to December 2016 (that’s 12 × 5 = 60 items of data per
stock). Compute the sample monthly means and the sample covariance matrix for this
data. Assuming these are the true means and covariances for yet-to-be observed monthly
returns:

(a) Compute the weights of the minimum variance portfolio. What is the formula for the
efficient frontier? Show a plot of the efficient frontier together with the locations of the 30
individual stocks.

(b) Assume the monthly risk-free rate of return is 0.15%. What are the weights of the
market portfolio?

(c) What are the weights of the efficient portfolio corresponding to an expected monthly
return of 0.3%?
